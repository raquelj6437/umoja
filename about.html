                I’d like to say my favorite cartoon character is Missy from Big Mouth because as the show progressed, she became more empowering and began to recognize that she was worth more than just some little girl. I feel like I can resonate with her because over time I opened up more and started to embrace myself more than I used to.

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>To create a healthy environment, for Black students and all individuals who are interested in black culture, which actively unites students, staff and alumni by providing pertinent educational, social, and community outreach programming.</p>

    <div id="history">
      <h2>History of Umoja</h2>
      <p>The organization was founded in 1967, at a time when African Americans across the country were mobilizing around civil rights. In its early years, members fought against racial injustice on campus and beyond. They protested the
        University’s lack of African American faculty in 1969 and created a legal defense fund the next year in support of activist Angela Davis, prosecuted for conspiracy involving the armed takeover of a Marin County, Calif., courtroom that left
        four people dead, and later acquitted in a federal trial. Today, the club’s mission is to support and represent black students both within and outside the University, as well as to educate the BU community about the black experience and
        promote unity through its forums and other events during the year.</p>
